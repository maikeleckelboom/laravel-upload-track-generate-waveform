# BPM Calculation from Aubio Beat Output

This guide provides instructions for calculating BPM (beats per minute) from beat timestamps generated by `aubio beat`.

## Steps to Calculate BPM

1. **Collect Beat Timestamps**  
   The `aubio beat` command outputs timestamps where beats occur. For example:

    ```plaintext
    0.456
    1.230
    2.013
    2.786
    ...
    ```

2. **Calculate Time Differences (Intervals)**  
   Subtract each timestamp from the one that follows it to get the time intervals between beats. For example:
    ```plaintext
    Interval 1: 1.230 - 0.456 = 0.774 seconds
    Interval 2: 2.013 - 1.230 = 0.783 seconds
    Interval 3: 2.786 - 2.013 = 0.773 seconds
    ```

3. **Calculate Average Beat Interval**  
   Once you have the intervals, calculate the average of these intervals (in seconds).

4. **Convert to BPM**  
   Convert the average beat interval to BPM using the following formula:

    ```plaintext
    BPM = 60 / (average beat interval in seconds)
    ```

## Example Calculation

Given the following timestamps:

```plaintext
0.456
1.230
2.013
2.786
```

   Convert the average beat interval to BPM using the following formula:

    ```

## Example Calculation

Given the following timestamps:

```plaintext
0.456
1.230
2.013
2.786
```
Step 1: Calculate intervals

```
Interval 1: 1.230 - 0.456 = 0.774 seconds
Interval 2: 2.013 - 1.230 = 0.783 seconds
Interval 3: 2.786 - 2.013 = 0.773 seconds
```
Step 2: Average the intervals

```
Average interval = (0.774 + 0.783 + 0.773) / 3 = 0.777 seconds
```
Step 3: Convert to BPM

```
BPM = 60 / 0.777 â‰ˆ 77.21 BPM
```
